How to setup Akonadi:
Of course you have to install the akonadiserver (openSUSE the akonadi-runtime package),
the resources are in the kdepim-runtime package where are also the config modules and utilities.
From 4.4 akonadi settings aren't anymore in systemsettings, you must use the akonaditray utility.
Create a file $HOME/.local/share/akonadi/mysql-local.conf
with the content
user=username
where username is you your username.

If you get errors in the server test like
[Warning] Can't open and lock time zone table: Table 'mysql.time_zone_leap_second' doesn't exist trying to live without them
[ERROR] Can't open and lock privilege tables: Table 'mysql.servers' doesn't exist
[ERROR] Cannot open mysql.db
[ERROR] Cannot open mysql.user
[ERROR] Cannot open mysql.event

Execute from a terminal with the running akonadiserver:
mysql_install_db --datadir=$HOME/.local/share/akonadi/db_data/
mysql_upgrade --socket=$HOME/.local/share/akonadi/db_misc/mysql.socket
Then stop and restart the server.

Then you can add resources.

Some time ago it was planned that pim 4.5 will be released with KDE SC 4.5.1,
unfortunately that didn't happen, currently no release date is known, afaik.
As the behavior with signal for added/removed items is different between 4.4 and 4.5
I added some ifdefs in eventmodel.cpp (around line 224, 254, 265). Maybe you need to adjust the kdeversion.
