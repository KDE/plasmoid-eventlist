How to setup Akonadi:
Of course you have to install the akonadiserver (openSUSE the akonadi-runtime package),
the resources are in the kdepim-runtime package where are also the config modules and utilities.
From 4.4 akonadi settings aren't anymore in systemsettings, you must use the akonaditray utility.
Create a file $HOME/.local/share/akonadi/mysql-local.conf
with the content
user=username
where username is you your username.

If you get errors in the server test like
[Warning] Can't open and lock time zone table: Table 'mysql.time_zone_leap_second' doesn't exist trying to live without them
[ERROR] Can't open and lock privilege tables: Table 'mysql.servers' doesn't exist
[ERROR] Cannot open mysql.db
[ERROR] Cannot open mysql.user
[ERROR] Cannot open mysql.event

Execute from a terminal with the running akonadiserver:
mysql_install_db --datadir=$HOME/.local/share/akonadi/db_data/
mysql_upgrade --socket=$HOME/.local/share/akonadi/db_misc/mysql.socket
Then stop and restart the server.

Then you can add resources.
For 4.3 I suggest setting all resources to read only and keep the standard resources for e.g. korganizer.
Who is using 4.4 should know what he is doing. ;-)

With 4.4 is a problem with signals from the monitor
if an item is added we receive a "item added" signal for all already existing item?
this may lead to strange behavior with 4.4
(tested on opensuse 11.2 + factory, kubuntu 10.04, mandriva)
