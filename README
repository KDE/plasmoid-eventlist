To install:

To build out of the source tree
unpack the archive,
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix` PATH_TO_APPLET_ROOT
make 
sudo make install or su -c "make install"
kbuildsycoca4

where PATH_TO_APPLET_ROOT is the path to the applet source (e.g. $HOME/plasmoid-eventlist-0.3.95/).

To test the applet from a shell use
plasmoidviewer plasma_applet_events

If you use kdepim 4.6 (the runtime stuff, not pimlibs) and open events/todos with rightclick does not work try
adding -DHAS_AKONADI_PIM=1 to cmake

How to setup Akonadi:
Of course you have to install the akonadiserver (openSUSE the akonadi-runtime package),
the resources are in the kdepim-runtime package where are also the config modules and utilities.
From 4.4 akonadi settings aren't anymore in systemsettings, you must use the akonaditray utility.
Create a file $HOME/.local/share/akonadi/mysql-local.conf
with the content
user=username
where username is you your username.

If you get errors in the server test like
[Warning] Can't open and lock time zone table: Table 'mysql.time_zone_leap_second' doesn't exist trying to live without them
[ERROR] Can't open and lock privilege tables: Table 'mysql.servers' doesn't exist
[ERROR] Cannot open mysql.db
[ERROR] Cannot open mysql.user
[ERROR] Cannot open mysql.event

Execute from a terminal with the running akonadiserver:
mysql_install_db --datadir=$HOME/.local/share/akonadi/db_data/
mysql_upgrade --socket=$HOME/.local/share/akonadi/db_misc/mysql.socket
Then stop and restart the server.

Then you can add resources.
